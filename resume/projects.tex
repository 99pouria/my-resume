    {This project is an automated program repair tool tailored specifically for Golang, with a focus on improving concurrent code reliability. Its primary goal is to assist developers in debugging and automatically repairing concurrency-related issues, particularly the common problem of missing \texttt{sync.WaitGroup} usage when managing goroutines.}

    {Modified xv6, a simple Unix-like teaching OS developed at MIT, by implementing a round-robin scheduler to manage CPU time fairly among processes. Added a custom system call, getChildren, by extending the process structure and modifying the fork syscall to track child processes using a new global variable.}
