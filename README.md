## My Resume

### Description
This repository contains my resume files implemented using Awesome CV, a LaTeX template for a CV (Curriculum Vitae). The template is stylish, yet professional, and it allows for easy customization.

### Files
- **resume.tex**: The main LaTeX file for the resume.
- **awesome-cv.cls**: The class file that defines the layout and formatting.
- **/fonts, /cv**: Folders containing additional files for the template.

### Usage
1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
2. **Customization**: Edit the `resume.tex` file to include your own information, such as name, contact details, work experience, education, etc.
3. **Compilation**: Use a LaTeX editor or the command line to compile the `resume.tex` file into a PDF.

### Example
You can see an example of the resume by opening the `PouriaKalantari.pdf` file in the repository.
